# PINFE

A frontend for vpinball for linux, windows, mac.

## Note
This is not ready for consumption as I'm just putting in the plumbing.  You can pull a CI build if you want to see what it looks like.  RIGHT_SHIFT will switch tables (Only 2) and ESCAPE will exit.

Keyboard: 
- SHIFT_LEFT = Table shift left
- SHIFT_RIGHT = Table shift right
- ESCAPE = Exit

Joystick
- Left_Bumper = Table shift left
- Right_Bumber = Table shift right
